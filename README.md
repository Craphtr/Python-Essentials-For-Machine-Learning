> **by Jubril Davies**



A repository containing essential fundamental elements of data handling in Machine Learning. This is not meant to be exhaustive but a starting point for every newcomer into the world of data science. 

## **Topics covered include:**

* **Array Creation using Numpy Arrays**

* **Indexing and Slicing in Numpy Arrays**

* **Computation using Numpy Arrays**

* **Broadcasting operations using Numpy Arrays**

* **Constructing Series & DataFrames**

* **Indexing and Slicing Series & DataFrames**

* **Operations on Pandas Data Structures**

* **Data Cleaning - Handling Invalid Data, Missing Data, Duplicate data**

* **Data Wrangling - Merging, Transformation,Reshaping**


The codes in the jupyter notebooks have been structured in a easy to follow format highlighting the goal of a cell before implementation of its code. 

The notebooks can be downloaded and worked on for independent study
